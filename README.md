# Modern Greek flashcards


I found [this list](http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/language/ModernGreekFlashCards.pdf)
of 5,000 modern Greek words (which appears to be linked to
[this page](http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/) at York University, but I can't
otherwise find a way to credit the creator of this list). It's a pdf, so I
parsed it into a tab-separated format (using `pdftotext` and Python). Enjoy!
