# Modern Greek flashcards

I found [http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/language/ModernGreekFlashCards.pdf](this
list) of 5,000 modern Greek words (which appears to be linked to
[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/](this page) at York University, but I can't
otherwise find a way to credit the creator of this list). It's a pdf, so I
parsed it into a tab-separated format (using `pdftotext` and Python). Enjoy!
